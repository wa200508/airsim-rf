# End-to-end RF pipeline result

deterministic AirSim-contract trajectory; physics/RPC not exercised.

**All stages are in milliseconds per complete fleet update.**

Measurement mode: unprofiled_end_to_end_benchmark. Instrumented runs are separate from throughput results.

| Configuration / stage (ms) | advance_ms | source_ms | channel_ms | rendering_ms | receiver_ms | other_rf_ms | delivery_storage_ms | total_ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 10 TX × 4 RX, basis-cuda; trajectory source | 0.00 | 4.54 | 12.14 | 36.12 | 3.66 | 5.59 | 4.24 | 64.46 |

Measured windows: 30; simulated duration: 250.0000 ms.

Wall time / simulated time: **7.41×**. Deadline misses: 30/30.

Propagation backend: Sionna RT CUDA/OptiX. Paths are physical scene returns, not the synthetic 1028-valid-path stress workload.

Initialization is excluded from steady-state tables; the first complete capture is recorded separately in JSON.

Receivers execute serially; delivery uses loopback HTTP, not the AMS-GRA native worker protocol. Consumer writes are read back but not fsync-ed.
