# End-to-end RF pipeline result

deterministic AirSim-contract trajectory; physics/RPC not exercised.

**All stages are wall milliseconds per RF fleet update, generating ~8.333 ms of signal per receiver.**

Measurement mode: unprofiled_end_to_end_benchmark. Instrumented runs are separate from throughput results.

| Configuration / stage (ms) | advance_ms | source_ms | channel_ms | rendering_ms | receiver_ms | other_rf_ms | delivery_storage_ms | total_ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2 TX × 2 RX, basis-cuda; trajectory source | 0.00 | 1.11 | 9.88 | 11.62 | 1.46 | 1.54 | 2.20 | 27.12 |

Measured updates: 30; actual signal duration per receiver: 0.250000 seconds; total measured fleet wall service: 0.763550 seconds.

Wall seconds / simulated signal second: **3.05×**. Deadline misses: 30/30.

Propagation backend: Sionna RT CUDA/OptiX. Paths are physical scene returns, not the synthetic 1028-valid-path stress workload.

Initialization is excluded from steady-state tables; the first complete capture is recorded separately in JSON.

Receivers execute serially; delivery uses loopback HTTP, not the AMS-GRA native worker protocol. Consumer writes are read back but not fsync-ed.

<!-- BEGIN SIGNAL TIME CONTEXT -->

**Simulation-time reference:** wall seconds per simulated signal second = total measured wall service / total output signal duration per receiver. Receiver durations are concurrent, not added across receivers. This is a processing-cost ratio for the named scope; it is not a whole-flight measurement. Instrumented costs are diagnostic.

| Raw case / timed scope | Mode | Calls | Signal ms/call (mean) | Measured signal seconds | Measured wall seconds | Wall seconds / signal second |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| [results/profiling/p100-adaptive-pipeline-full-20261008/profiles/cuda-2tx-2rx-unprofiled/measurements.json](measurements.json) — RF fleet update | unprofiled_end_to_end_benchmark | 30 | 8.333333 | 0.250000 | 0.763550 | 3.054 |

The measured signal seconds column totals processed windows. Synthetic and historical short-capture jobs may reuse epochs or leave gaps; this total does not assert a continuous simulation timeline. First-use/warmup are excluded where the recorded harness excludes them. Stage milliseconds elsewhere use the same signal duration as their parent call; stage median / signal-ms is a median cost ratio, while the final column above uses sums (equivalently mean costs for fixed-duration calls).
