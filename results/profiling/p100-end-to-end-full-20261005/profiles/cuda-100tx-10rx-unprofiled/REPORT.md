# End-to-end RF pipeline result

deterministic AirSim-contract trajectory; physics/RPC not exercised.

**All stages are in milliseconds per complete fleet update.**

Measurement mode: unprofiled_end_to_end_benchmark. Instrumented runs are separate from throughput results.

| Configuration / stage (ms) | advance_ms | source_ms | channel_ms | rendering_ms | receiver_ms | other_rf_ms | delivery_storage_ms | total_ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 100 TX × 10 RX, basis-cuda; trajectory source | 0.00 | 39.12 | 347.26 | 403.70 | 9.82 | 70.95 | 8.89 | 860.18 |

Measured windows: 30; simulated duration: 250.0000 ms.

Wall time / simulated time: **101.43×**. Deadline misses: 30/30.

Scene propagation is CPU even when rendering uses CUDA. Paths are physical scene returns, not the synthetic 1028-valid-path stress workload.

Initialization is excluded from steady-state tables; the first complete capture is recorded separately in JSON.

Receivers execute serially; delivery uses loopback HTTP, not the AMS-GRA native worker protocol. Consumer writes are read back but not fsync-ed.
