# End-to-end RF pipeline result

**Timing scope:** RF fleet-update wall service; serial receivers; trajectory source and loopback consumer. [Common measurement definitions](../../../../TIMING_CONVENTIONS.md) apply to units, statistics, cache state, ratios and comparisons. Historical measurements and estimates are not current fleet-update qualification.

<!-- BEGIN SIGNAL TIME CONTEXT -->

**Simulation-time reference:** wall seconds per simulated signal second = total measured wall service / total output signal duration per receiver. Receiver durations are concurrent, not added across receivers. This is a processing-cost ratio for the named scope; it is not a whole-flight measurement. Instrumented costs are diagnostic.

| Raw case / timed scope | Mode | Calls | Signal ms/call (mean) | Measured signal seconds | Measured wall seconds | Wall seconds / signal second |

The measured signal seconds column totals processed windows. Synthetic and historical short-capture jobs may reuse epochs or leave gaps; this total does not assert a continuous simulation timeline. First-use/warmup are excluded where the recorded harness excludes them. Stage milliseconds elsewhere use the same signal duration as their parent call; stage median / signal-ms is a median cost ratio, while the final column above uses sums (equivalently mean costs for fixed-duration calls).

deterministic AirSim-contract trajectory; physics/RPC not exercised.

**All stages are in milliseconds per complete fleet update.**

Measurement mode: unprofiled_end_to_end_benchmark. Instrumented runs are separate from throughput results.

Measured windows: 2; simulated duration: 16.6670 ms.

Wall time / simulated time: **7.62×**. Deadline misses: 2/2.

Propagation backend: Sionna RT CUDA/OptiX. Paths are physical scene returns, not the synthetic 1028-valid-path stress workload.

Initialization is excluded from steady-state tables; the first complete capture is recorded separately in JSON.

Receivers execute serially; delivery uses loopback HTTP, not the AMS-GRA native worker protocol. Consumer writes are read back but not fsync-ed.
